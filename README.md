# Pi-hole: custom blockpage with whitelist request button
Custom Pi-hole blockpage with a button to send a request (via mail) to whitelist the blocked domain.

This project is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHjCO1zxpMA which explains how to set up a custom blockpage for pi-hole.
After setting up my custom blockpage, I've thaught it would be cool to give my family the opportunity to reqeust whitelisting a domain they can't reach.
